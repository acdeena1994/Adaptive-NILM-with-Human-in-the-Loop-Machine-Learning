# Adaptive-NILM-with-Human-in-the-Loop-Machine-Learning
An end-to-end Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) system that combines high-precision hardware with an adaptive machine learning feedback loop. By integrating user labeling into the training pipeline, the system evolves to recognize specific household appliances with increasing precision.
